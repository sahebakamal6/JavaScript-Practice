// ============JAVASCRIPT SECOND ASSIGNMENT

//CHAPTER 01:Alert

// Qno 1: What does the alert function do in JavaScript?

//Answetr: alert shows a pop up box with a message to the user like warnings and feedbacks

// Qno 02: Write the code to display an alert with the message "Welcome to my website!".

//Answer:

alert('Welcome to my website!');

// Qno 03: What happens if you capitalize the alert keyword?

//Answer:the code will not run because javascript is code sensitive.

// Qno 4:Write the correct JavaScript syntax to display "Hello, world!" in an alert box.

//Answer:just write the message for example Hello World or Hello Coders in an alert 
//like the example given below

alert("Hello World!");

// Qno 5:Write a JavaScript alert statement with proper formatting and explain each part of the code.
//Answer:"alert":is a function,using this we can display a message to a user,"()":these ar parenthesis,between these round brackets we write a statement(just String like text or message cuz numbers and variable used without quotation makrs) using quotes,those quotes can be single ` `,double " " and backticks ` `.We can write string,number or different variable types in between these round brackets.at the end we use semi colon ";",which ends the alert.
alert("Saheba Kamal");

//CHAPTER 02:Variable for Strings

// Qno 1:Write code that declares a variable message, assigns the value "Hello, world!" to
// it, and then displays an alert with that message.

//Answer:

alert(greetingHello);

// Qno 2:Declare a variable named age, leave it undefined, then assign the value 25 to it in a later statement. Display an alert showing the value of age.

//Answer:

var age ;
age = 25
alert(age);



// Qno 3:Declare a variable named greeting, assign it the value "Good morning!", and then

alert("Name:" + userName + "\n"+"Email:"+ userEmail +"\n" + "Password:"+ userPassword);

//Qno 07:Declare a variable userAddress that contains spaces (i.e., try naming it like user address)and observe what happens. Then correct the name using camelCase and display the value in an alert.
//Answer:
//ðŸ‘‡this code is showing an error because of the illegal variable name,like while giving a variable name we can't put space between variable names...
// var user address = "L-481,sec 35/D";
// alert(user address)

//so the correct code is this:
var userAddress = "L-481,sec 35/D"
alert(userAddress);

//Qno 08:Create a variable rose and assign it a value "Floribundas". Then, try accessing the variable using Rose (uppercase) and see what happens. Display both results.
//Answer:
//this code is not running because of the case sensitive issue of java script
//we write this "rose" in variable name and now in alert we write "Rose",that cuz error because rose is defined and Rose is not...!
//ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
// var rose = "Floribundas"
// alert(Rose)

//the correct code is here:
var rose = "Floribundas"
alert(rose)

alert(newNumb);

//Qno 02:Write a program that initializes a variable counter with the value 10. Use counter++ twice in your code, then display the final value of counter in an alert.
//Answer:

//CHAPTER 05:Math expressions: Eliminating ambiguity

//Qno 01:Combine parentheses and the modulus operator % to first calculate the remainder of 20 % 6 before performing the other arithmetic operations. What is the value of calculation?

//Answer:The value will be the answer of 20%6,it means the remainder(2),because in any calculation method,first parenthesis equation should be calculate and after that others.

 //Qno 02:Write an expression that calculates (6 + 2) * (5 - 3), and determine the value of expressionValue.
//Answer:
var expressionValue = (6 + 2) * (5 - 3)
alert(expressionValue);

 //Qno 03:What is the value of finalTotal in the following expression, and how does operator precedence apply here?
//Answer:the final total answer of the following expression were 16 and now we observe how did it work,as i said earlier that in math expression if we have some equation under oor outside the brackets so the bracket values should be calculate first,so there we had (6 + 2) * (5 - 3),in this exppression:first it solved bracket values:6+2=8 and 5-3=2,now we have 8 * 2,now we just have to multiply those values which will be 16.

 //Qno 04:Evaluate the value of answer and determine how JavaScript processes the following expression:
//Answer:bt applying BODMAS(BRACKET OFF,DIVISION,MULTIPLICATIO,ADDITION AND SUBTRACTION) rule,in the following expression,it solved bracket value first and after solving both brackets,it multiplied the values.
